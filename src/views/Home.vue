        <div >
        I am an Electrical Engineer who has been working in the high power field. After 10+ years
        working with Control and Automation of Converter and Power substations, I took the decision
        to enroll in a Masterâ€™s Degree course in Computer Engineering to increase my knowledge
        in IoT, Computer Networks and Advanced Computing. Now I am a PhD candidate at ENAC
        studying distributed computing in dynamic networks.
