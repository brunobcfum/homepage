    "abstract" : "Designing and deploying mobile applications for Edge/Fog environments is challenging. Previous studies have introduced simulation and emulation tools that can help to model new applications but fail to deliver an environment in which a system designer can emulate a realistic deployment of such applications. We propose the Mobile Ad-hoc Computing Framework (MACE) that provides features which facilitate and accelerate the development and testing of Edge/Fog applications. It also provides the nodes with mobility control that can be modelled or triggered by external applications, such as a flight simulator. With the included GUI, the user can plan deployment topologies, observe and interact with the nodes in real-Time. To demonstrate its functionalities, two experimental evaluations were performed: one comparing the network emulators and another with an off-The-shelf configuration service running in mobile nodes. Finally, the functionality of controlling mobility via an external application is also demonstrated."

    "abstract" : "In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), typically composed of nodes with resource constraints, leveraging efficient processes is crucial to enhance the network lifetime and, consequently, the sustainability in ultra-dense and heterogeneous environments, such as smart cities.\nParticularly, balancing the energy required to transport data efficiently across such dynamic environments poses significant challenges to routing protocol design and operation, being the trade-off of reducing data redundancy while achieving an acceptable delivery rate a fundamental research topic.\nIn this way, this work proposes a new energy-aware epidemic protocol that uses the current state of the network energy to create a dynamic distribution topology by self-adjusting each node forwarding behavior as eager or lazy according to the local residual battery. Simulated evaluations demonstrate its efficiency in energy consumption, delivery rate, and reduced computational burden when compared with classical gossip protocols as well as with a directional protocol."
